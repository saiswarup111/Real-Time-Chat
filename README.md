ðŸ§  Real-Time Chat Application
This Real-Time Chat App is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), combined with Socket.io for real-time communication. It features a modern UI built with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience. Users can register, log in securely with JWT-based authentication, and enjoy seamless authorization throughout the app.

One of the core highlights of the project is the real-time messaging system powered by Socket.io. The app keeps track of online users and enables instant message delivery and reception without needing to refresh the page. It also includes global state management using Zustand, and both server-side and client-side error handling to ensure reliability and robustness under various conditions.
